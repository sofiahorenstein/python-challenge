PyBank Analysis: 
In this assignment, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. This script analyzed a financial data set called budget_data.csv composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 

In its analysis, the PyBank script completed these tasks:
1. Tallied the total number of months included in the dataset
2. Calculated the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. Calculated the average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
4. Calculated greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5. Calculated greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
6. The final script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.

PyPoll Analysis:
In this assignment, I created a Python script to count votes in a small, rural town. I used poll data from a data set called  election_data.csv composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. 

In its analysis, the PyPoll script analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following:
1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. The final script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.
